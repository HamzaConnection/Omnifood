This projects purpose was made to train myself in oldschool html and css and create a responsive design I learned from a udemy tutorial.

It doesn't use any new frameworks and it's also the old school way of doing things.

I will commit another project in my respository where I use SASS and Flexbox and other more newer ways of working with CSS in the future.

Shout to Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy course Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 that taught me how to build this site.
